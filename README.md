# MindPost
A blogging platform with user profiles, likes, notifications, commenting, and an intuitive administrative system.

### About
MindPost was made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and PHP/MySQL for server-side/back-end actions. It features login/signup, categories, likes, comments, search queries, an advanced admin tool, and much more.

### How can I use it?
Once I upload a fresh SQL dump you can make a database and import it on phpMyAdmin and run the platform. That's coming soon.
